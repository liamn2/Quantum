<b>26/06/2025 (Thursday)</b>: Created quantum.qs, my first program in the Q# programming language.  
<b>27/06/2025 (Friday)</b>: Created random-number-gen.qs, a program to generate random numbers. Added entanglement.qs to set qubit state, perform Bell's test on two qubits, put a qubit in superposition and entangle two qubits.  
<b>04/07/2025 (Friday)</b>: Created syntax.qs to examine correct program structure. Provides notes on pre-set qubit parameters.
